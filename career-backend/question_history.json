["A particle moves along the x-axis with an initial velocity of 10 m/s and a constant acceleration of -2 m/s\u00b2.  At what time(s) will the particle be 12 meters away from its starting point?", "A projectile is launched from the ground with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 30\u00b0 above the horizontal.  Ignoring air resistance, what is the approximate horizontal distance the projectile travels before hitting the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s\u00b2)", "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2 m/s\u00b2 for 10 seconds. It then maintains a constant velocity for 5 seconds before decelerating uniformly to rest in 5 seconds. What is the total distance covered by the car?", "A ball is thrown vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 20 m/s.  Another ball is dropped from a height of 40m at the same instant. At what height above the ground will the two balls meet? (Assume g = 10 m/s\u00b2)", "Choose the word that is closest in meaning to 'gregarious':", "Choose the word that is most similar in meaning to 'Diligent':", "Choose the word that is the opposite in meaning to 'Happy':", "Choose the word that best completes the sentence: The sun was ______ behind the clouds.", "Choose the word that is closest in meaning to 'Enormous':", "Choose the word that is closest in meaning to 'Diligent':"]
